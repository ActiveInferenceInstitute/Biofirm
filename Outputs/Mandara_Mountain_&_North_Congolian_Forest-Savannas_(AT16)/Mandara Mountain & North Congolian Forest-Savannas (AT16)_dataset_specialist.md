- **Monitoring Programs:** NGOs like the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) operate monitoring programs.

### 7. Data Quality and Accessibility Assessment

**Data Completeness:**
- **Gaps:** There is a need for more comprehensive and accessible datasets on soil health, air quality, and socio-economic impacts.

**Temporal Coverage:**
- **Baseline Studies:** Historical data are limited, especially for long-term ecological trends pre-dating the 20th century.

**Spatial Resolution:**
- **Assessment:** High-resolution data are increasingly available from satellite imagery but vary in quality and accessibility.

**Data Access Conditions:**
- **Restrictions:** Some datasets are restricted due to privacy concerns or require institutional access.

**Interoperability:**
- **Compatibility:** Datasets often lack standardization, making integration challenging.
