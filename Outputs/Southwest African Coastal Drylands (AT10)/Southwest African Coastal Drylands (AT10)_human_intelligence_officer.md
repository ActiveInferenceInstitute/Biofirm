### Bibliography

As this analysis is based on generalized knowledge without specific search results for the Southwest African Coastal Drylands, a comprehensive bibliography specific to this region would need to be developed through further research. Key sources could include:

- **Organizational websites**: Such as those for NGOs, government departments, and research institutions.
- **Scientific journals**: Focused on ecology and environmental science in southern Africa.
- **Reports from regional initiatives**: Such as the SADC and other regional environmental projects.
- **News articles**: Covering environmental issues and developments in Namibia and South Africa.

This framework outlines a structured approach to stakeholder mapping in the Southwest African Coastal Drylands, highlighting the need for in-depth research to gather specific details on key actors and their roles in the region.
