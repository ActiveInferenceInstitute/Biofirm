- **Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)**: Offers species occurrence data for the region.

## 7. Data Quality and Accessibility Assessment

### Data Completeness and Gaps
- Key gaps include comprehensive datasets on soil health and detailed socioeconomic analyses linking environmental conditions to human well-being.

### Temporal Coverage
- Long-term climate and ecological monitoring data are available, but there is a need for more frequent updates.

### Spatial Resolution
- High-resolution spatial data are limited for certain environmental parameters, such as air quality and water quality.

### Data Access Conditions
- Most datasets are publicly accessible through open data initiatives, but some require permission or subscription.

## 8. Research Expectations

### Emerging Research Directions
