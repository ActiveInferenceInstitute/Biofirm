# Casey at the Neural Bat: An Active Inference Tale

The outlook wasn't brilliant for the homeostatic game that day,
The entropy was rising, free energy held sway.
The variables were drifting far from bounds they ought to keep,
And ecosystem stability was falling fast and deep.

A few had seen their priors fail, while others went astray,
The former certainty of control had somehow slipped away.
The random strategies had failed to keep the system sound,
The noise was overwhelming - chaos spreading all around.

But Active Inference Casey, with her POMDP might,
Had kept her generative model tuned precise and tight.
Her A-matrix mapped observations clean and clear,
While B-transitions charted paths through policy frontiers.

Her preferences encoded in a pristine C-vector's form,
Sought homeostatic balance as her regulatory norm.
Three states she could perceive - LOW, HOMEOSTATIC, HIGH,
And actions she could take to make the system comply.

The ecosystem variables danced beyond constraint,
While random controls proved increasingly too faint.
But Casey's variational free energy stayed keen,
As she minimized surprise in ways yet unseen.

The first observation came like lightning through the night,
A LOW state detected - things weren't nearly right.
But Casey's inference engine sprang into the fray,
Computing posterior beliefs to light the way.

The policy selection phase brought options into view,
As expected free energy showed her what to do.
The risk and ambiguity she balanced with such grace,
Selecting actions optimal for this time and place.

Control signals flowed like poetry in motion,
Each scaled by strength parameters with perfect devotion.
The system responded to her regulatory art,
As state transitions followed paths incredibly smart.

Five thousand timesteps passed under her steady hand,
The satisfaction rates rose just as she had planned.
Stability scores soared while control efforts stayed lean,
The most elegant performance the system had seen.

Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;
Random strategies are playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,
And somewhere agents flail about with no clear goal in sight;
But there is joy in Biofirmâ€”mighty Casey's got it right!

Her active inference framework proved its worthy cause,
Maintaining homeostasis with natural system laws.
The free energy principle had shown its profound might,
As Casey's generative model kept the future bright.

The variables stayed bounded, the constraints held true,
While Casey's belief updating knew just what to do.
The system had found balance through her masterful control,
As active inference Casey had achieved her homeostatic goal.

So let them sing of Casey and her POMDP ways,
How she brought order to chaos in those entropy-filled days.
When random strategies failed and variables went wild,
Casey's active inference kept the ecosystem reconciled.

For this is more than baseball that our Casey plays so well,
It's the dance of life and order that her matrices foretell.
Through observation, inference, and actions finely tuned,
Casey keeps our world in balance, like a perfect cosmic rune.

And when they ask of Casey why she never seems to fail,
The answer lies in principles that time cannot assail:
The free energy minimum that guides her every move,
The generative model that has everything to prove.

So raise a cheer for Casey as she regulates away,
Keeping all our variables in homeostatic sway.
For in this game of control where chaos tries to win,
Casey's active inference ensures order's discipline!
