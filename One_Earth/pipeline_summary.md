# Pipeline Execution Summary

## Research Phase
- Successfully generated research reports for all 5 bioregions
- Each bioregion has individual research files for each persona (ecological_researcher, human_intelligence_officer, dataset_specialist)
- Consolidated research files were created for each bioregion

## Business Case Generation
- Failed to generate business cases due to a naming pattern mismatch
- The script is looking for files with '*_report_*.md' pattern
- The actual research files are named with the pattern '[Bioregion Name]_[persona].md'

## Visualization
- Word cloud files were created for each region
- Errors occurred with t-SNE processing (requires at least 3 documents)
- Dimension reduction errors occurred

## Overall
- The pipeline completed successfully with an exit code of 0
- The research phase worked correctly
- The business case generation and visualization phases need fixes
