Note that we are running the full pipeline on March 8, with the cheaper Sonor model. We could use deep research, and other costlier + more effective methods in the future.

# OE Expert Network Tool - Next Steps

## Project Overview
The OE Expert Network Tool aims to largely automate One Earth's process of identifying and engaging with subject matter experts across all 185 bioregions. The tool serves as a key component of One Earth's Knowledge Management system, enabling the organization to build a comprehensive expert network organized by topical expertise within specific geographic boundaries.

The tool focuses on the three pillars of One Earth's action framework:
- Renewable Energy
- Nature Conservation
- Regenerative Agriculture

## Key Features
- Frictionless expert recruitment via email campaigns
- Simple survey interface with minimal time commitment (1-2 minutes)
- Geographic expertise mapping using One Earth's bioregional framework
- Expert nomination system to build a social graph of recommendations
- No logins required for initial participation
- Campaign-based approach to target specific areas of expertise
- Multi-tier expert recruitment through referrals
- Weighted results based on nomination frequency

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP Development (4-6 weeks)
- Create basic survey flow with campaign management
- Implement expert invitation system with tracking links
- Develop database backend (likely using AirTable)
- Build simple nomination tracking system
- Implement geographic expertise selection UI
- Deploy initial version for Land Cover SME campaign

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (6-8 weeks)
- Social graph visualization and analytics
- Expert weighting algorithm based on nomination frequency
- Automated result compilation and reporting
- Integration with Semantic Scholar API for expert verification

- Estimated completion time: 1-2 minutes

## Campaign Types

### Campaign Concept 1: Land Cover SMEs
This initial campaign will focus on building a network of experts in regional Land Cover Mapping. The process will follow a hierarchical nomination pattern:

1. **Realm Level Experts** (14 geographic realms)
   - Initial 50+ experts recruited directly by One Earth
   - Each nominates 5-10 experts at subrealm level

2. **Subrealm Level Experts** (52 subrealms)
   - Nominated by realm experts
   - Each nominates experts at bioregion level

3. **Bioregion Level Experts** (185 bioregions)
   - Nominated by subrealm experts
   - Provide detailed local expertise

**Future Application:** Experts will be invited to use a map markup tool to create a library of sample mapping tiles for training AI models to accurately differentiate between natural and anthropogenic land cover.

### Campaign Concept 2: Pollinator Plants
This campaign will focus on identifying optimal plants for creating pollinator meadows within each bioregion:

1. **Campaign Structure**
   - Parent survey: "Pollinator Meadows"
   - 185 bioregion-specific child surveys
   - Organized within 14 geographic realms

2. **Data Collection**
   - Plant recommendations (10-20 per bioregion)
   - Priority ratings (1-5 stars) for each plant
   - Supporting notes/information
   - Links to references if available

3. **Expert Validation**
   - Multi-tier nomination process
   - Weighted results based on nomination frequency
   - Publication under Creative Commons 4.0 license

**Output:** Region-specific plant lists to help property owners convert turf or degraded land into functioning pollinator meadows.

## Data Collection & Storage Strategy

   - Quadratic voting implementation (star ratings as multipliers)
   - Normalization procedures for fair representation

### Visualization Approaches
1. **Map-Based Interface**
   - Interactive world map with bioregion overlays
   - Hover information showing expert count and top names
   - Drill-down capability to view region-specific data

2. **List/Table Display**
   - Sortable expert directory
   - Filtering by expertise, region, or nomination count
   - Export functionality

3. **Network Graph**

- Estimated timeline: 1-2 weeks for initial data collection

## Positioning & Branding

### Positioning Statement
"The One Earth Expert Network is a planetary community of scientists grown by invitation that acts as a medium for communication, collaboration, and consensus-building. Because of it, scientists can contribute their knowledge to global challenges outside of institutional constraints. This is important because addressing climate change and biodiversity loss requires coordinated global expertise."

### Value Proposition
- For scientists: Connection to peers, recognition, impactful contribution
- For One Earth: Access to distributed expertise, data collection, community building
- For the public: Credible, region-specific knowledge made accessible

### Branding Considerations
- Use "One Earth Expert Group" branding (less intimidating than "network")
- Position as invitation-only, high-credibility platform
- Frame participation as contributing to global knowledge commons
- Emphasize Chatham House rules and data privacy

## Feedback System

### Implementation
- Simple feedback form on all survey pages
- Direct routing to One Earth staff
- Categories: Bug report, Feature request, Content suggestion, Other

### Usage
- Collect user experience issues
- Identify potential improvements
- Gather expert suggestions for future campaigns
- Build ongoing engagement

## Future Research Directions

## Additional Campaign Concepts

### Campaign Concept 3: Regional Climate Solutions
A campaign to identify the most effective regional climate solutions based on local expertise:

1. **Structure**
   - Two-stage survey process
   - First stage: Solution nomination by experts
   - Second stage: Prioritization and feasibility assessment

2. **Output Applications**
   - Region-specific climate solution portfolio
   - Implementation feasibility analysis
   - Policy recommendation documentation

### Campaign Concept 4: Ecosystem Restoration Monitoring
A campaign to build consensus on key indicators for monitoring ecosystem restoration success:

1. **Methodology**
   - Expert nomination of indicator species/metrics
   - Weighted ranking based on scientific validity
   - Region-specific adaptations

2. **Output Applications**
   - Standardized monitoring protocols by ecosystem type
   - Early warning indicator sets
   - Restoration success benchmarks
