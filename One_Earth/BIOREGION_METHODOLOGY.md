# One Earth Bioregion Methodology

This document explains the methodology used by the One Earth Bioregion Analysis System for researching, analyzing, and developing regeneration plans for Earth's bioregions.

## Overview of the Bioregion Approach

The One Earth system uses a bioregional approach to ecological analysis and regeneration planning. This approach recognizes that Earth's ecosystems can be divided into distinct bioregions - geographical areas defined by natural characteristics rather than political boundaries.

### Bioregion Classification System

The One Earth system uses a comprehensive classification of Earth's terrestrial bioregions based on a synthesis of multiple ecological classification systems, including:

1. Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World (Olson et al., 2001)
2. Biogeographic Realms (Wallace, 1876)
3. Biodiversity Hotspots (Conservation International)
4. Indigenous Cultural Areas

This integrated classification results in 142 distinct bioregions globally, each with unique ecological characteristics and human-environment relationships.

## Research Methodology

The research methodology employs a structured approach using specialized research personas, systematic data collection, and multi-perspective analysis.

```

### 1. Vision Development

The regeneration planning begins with the development of a compelling vision for the bioregion that integrates ecological, social, and economic dimensions:

- **Ecological Vision**: Targets for ecosystem health, biodiversity, and ecological processes
- **Social Vision**: Goals for human wellbeing, cultural vitality, and social equity
- **Economic Vision**: Objectives for sustainable livelihoods, circular economy, and ecological economics

### 2. Strategy Formulation

Based on the vision, the system develops integrated strategies across four domains:

#### Restoration Strategies

Approaches for actively restoring degraded ecosystems:
