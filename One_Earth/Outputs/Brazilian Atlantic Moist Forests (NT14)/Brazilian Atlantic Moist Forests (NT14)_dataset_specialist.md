**Forest Inventory Data:**

- EMBRAPA conducts forest inventories to monitor tree cover and forest health, though detailed data may not always be publicly accessible.

**Agricultural Land Use Datasets:**

- Data on crop types and yields are available from agricultural research institutions, though specific management practices might require direct contact with local farmers.

**Urban Development and Infrastructure Mapping:**

- Urban planning datasets from municipalities provide insights into infrastructure development and urban sprawl impacts on natural habitats.

**Conservation Planning Tools:**

- Spatial prioritization analyses are conducted by NGOs and government agencies to identify areas for conservation efforts.

### 5. Socio-Ecological Datasets

**Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK):**

- Ethically compiled TEK databases are rare due to ethical considerations, but local indigenous communities possess valuable knowledge on sustainable land use.

**Socioeconomic Data:**

- National census data and research from socio-economic studies provide insights into natural resource use and environmental perceptions among local communities.

**Environmental Justice Mapping Tools:**

- Vulnerability assessments are conducted by NGOs and government agencies to identify areas of high environmental justice concern.
