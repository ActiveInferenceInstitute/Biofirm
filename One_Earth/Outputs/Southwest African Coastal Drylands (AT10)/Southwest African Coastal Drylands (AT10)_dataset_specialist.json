While there are robust datasets for species inventories and protected areas, gaps exist in long-term ecological monitoring and high-resolution spatial data. Emerging research focuses on climate change impacts and novel ecosystem services. Access to many datasets requires permission, but there is a strong presence of institutional and government data repositories. Future research should prioritize filling these data gaps and exploring socio-ecological interactions within the bioregion.",
