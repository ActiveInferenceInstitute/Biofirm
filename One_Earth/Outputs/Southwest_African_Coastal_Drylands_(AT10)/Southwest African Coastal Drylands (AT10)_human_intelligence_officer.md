## Introduction to the Southwest African Coastal Drylands (AT10) Bioregion

The Southwest African Coastal Drylands, designated as AT10, is a bioregion characterized by semi-arid to arid conditions, with significant biodiversity and unique ecological systems. This region spans across parts of Namibia and South Africa, featuring a diverse range of flora and fauna adapted to harsh desert conditions. The bioregion faces environmental challenges such as desertification, climate change impacts, and resource management issues, which necessitate comprehensive stakeholder engagement for sustainable development.
