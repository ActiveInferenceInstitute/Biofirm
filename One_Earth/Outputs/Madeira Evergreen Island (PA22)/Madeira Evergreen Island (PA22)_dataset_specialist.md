## Data Quality and Accessibility Assessment

### Data Completeness:
- **Gaps in Long-Term Ecological Monitoring**: There is a need for more comprehensive datasets covering long-term ecological trends.

### Temporal Coverage:
- **Historical Baselines**: Many datasets lack historical baselines, making it difficult to assess long-term changes.

### Spatial Resolution:
- **High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data**: Needed for detailed land cover and land use change analysis.

### Data Access Conditions:
- **Mixed Access**: Some datasets are openly available, while others require permission or subscription.

### Interoperability:
- **Compatibility Issues**: Some datasets are not easily integrated due to differences in format and resolution.

## Research Expectations

For future research, priority should be given to collecting long-term ecological data and improving data interoperability. The development of high-resolution spatial datasets is crucial for land use planning and conservation efforts.
