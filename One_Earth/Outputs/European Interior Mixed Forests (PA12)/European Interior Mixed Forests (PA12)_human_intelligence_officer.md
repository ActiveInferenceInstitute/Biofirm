To conduct a comprehensive analysis of the European Interior Mixed Forests bioregion (PA12), we will explore the key stakeholders and actors across various sectors. This includes academic researchers, governmental bodies, NGOs, private sector entities, indigenous and local community leaders, influential individuals, and networks. Additionally, we will assess stakeholder networks and identify potential partnerships.
