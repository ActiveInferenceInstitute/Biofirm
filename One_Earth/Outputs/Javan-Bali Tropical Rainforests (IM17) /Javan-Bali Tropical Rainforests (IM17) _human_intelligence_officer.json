  "research_data": "Given the extensive requirements, this analysis will focus on key stakeholders in the **Javan-Bali Tropical Rainforests (IM17)** bioregion. The region is critical for biodiversity and faces significant environmental challenges, including deforestation and habitat loss.\n\n## 1. Academic and Research Stakeholders\n\n### Leading Researchers and Institutions\n\n- **Prof. Dr. Rizaldi Boer**, a prominent figure in forestry and environmental science, works at the **Bogor Agricultural University (IPB)**, which is one of Indonesia's leading institutions in agriculture and environmental research[1][2].\n- **Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI)** conducts research on biodiversity and sustainability, particularly relevant to the Javan-Bali Rainforests[3].\n- **University of Indonesia** and **Gadjah Mada University** are other key institutions involved in environmental and ecological research in Indonesia[4].\n\n### Emerging Researchers and Collaborative Initiatives\n\nEmerging researchers often come from local universities and collaborate with international institutions on projects related to sustainable development and conservation. However, specific names might not be readily available without direct access to current academic publications or networks.\n\n**Consortiums and Networks:**\n- The **Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR)** collaborates with Indonesian institutions on projects related to forest management and sustainability[5].\n- **The Indonesian Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (IBSAP)** is a national initiative that involves academic stakeholders in conservation efforts.\n\n## 2.
