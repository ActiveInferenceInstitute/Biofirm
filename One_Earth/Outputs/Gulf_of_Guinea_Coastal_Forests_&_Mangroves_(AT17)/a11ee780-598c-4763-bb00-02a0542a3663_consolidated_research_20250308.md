**Research Opportunities and Challenges:**

1. **Biodiversity Surveys**: Comprehensive surveys are needed to fill gaps in species inventories, particularly for marine and freshwater species.
2. **Data Interoperability**: Enhancing data compatibility across different datasets and platforms is crucial for integrated analyses.
3. **Socioeconomic Data Integration**: Incorporating socioeconomic data into conservation planning can better align with community needs and environmental management practices.
4. **Traditional Ecological Knowledge**: Ethically compiled databases of traditional knowledge can enhance community-based conservation initiatives.
5. **High-Resolution Remote Sensing**: Increased spatial resolution of remote sensing data can improve land use change monitoring and habitat quality assessments.
