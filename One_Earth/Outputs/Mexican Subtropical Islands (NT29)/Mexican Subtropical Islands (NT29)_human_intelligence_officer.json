  "research_data": "Given the specifics of the Mexican Subtropical Islands (NT29) bioregion, this analysis will focus on identifying key stakeholders across various sectors. However, due to the lack of detailed information on this specific bioregion, the analysis will provide a general framework applicable to similar regions, with potential adaptations for a hypothetical NT29 bioregion.\n\n## 1. ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH STAKEHOLDERS\n\n### Leading Researchers and Institutions\n\n- **University of Mexico's Institute of Ecology**: Known for research on biodiversity and ecological systems, this institution could be a key player in studying the bioregion's unique ecosystems.\n- **National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC)**: Focuses on climate change and ecological research, potentially involving studies in subtropical regions.\n- **CIMMYT (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center)**: While primarily focused on agriculture, CIMMYT's research could extend to sustainable practices in subtropical regions.\n\n### Academic Networks and Initiatives\n\n- **Latin American and Caribbean Network for Environmental Economics (LACEEP)**: Could provide a platform for collaborative research on environmental economics in the bioregion.\n- **International Society for Ecological Economics (ISEE)**: Offers a global perspective on ecological economics, which could be applied to regional sustainability studies.\n\n### Emerging Researchers\n\n- Due to the specificity of the region, emerging researchers might include those involved in local universities or research centers focusing on biodiversity, sustainability, and climate change. Identifying specific individuals would require more detailed local information.\n\n## 2. GOVERNMENTAL AND POLICY ACTORS\n\n### Relevant Agencies\n\n- **Mexico's Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT)**: Oversees environmental policies and conservation efforts nationally, including potential oversight in the NT29 bioregion.\n- **National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO)**: Focuses on biodiversity conservation, which could be relevant to the bioregion's ecological systems.\n\n### Policymakers and Officials\n\n- Key policymakers would include department heads within SEMARNAT and local government officials responsible for environmental management in the bioregion.\n\n### Regulatory Bodies\n\n- **Federal Attorney for Environmental Protection (PROFEPA)**: Enforces environmental laws and regulations, including those relevant to resource management and conservation in the bioregion.\n\n### International Governance Initiatives\n\n- Initiatives like the **United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)** might have regional programs or partnerships relevant to subtropical island ecosystems.\n\n## 3.
