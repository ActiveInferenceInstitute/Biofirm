## Bioregion Analysis: North Alaskan Tundra (NA3)

### 1. Scientific Literature Mapping

**Peer-Reviewed Articles:**
- **Ecological Studies:** Research on the North Alaskan Tundra often focuses on climate change impacts, such as shifts in vegetation patterns and permafrost thaw. For example, studies have shown that warming temperatures are altering the distribution of plant species and affecting the carbon balance of the region (e.g., Chapin et al., 2005; McGuire et al., 2012).
- **Biodiversity:** Articles typically highlight the unique biodiversity of the tundra, including caribou, wolves, and various bird species. The region's biodiversity is crucial for understanding ecosystem resilience (e.g., Post et al., 2019).
- **Environmental Challenges:** Recent publications address environmental challenges like oil exploration, mining, and the impacts of climate change on indigenous communities (e.g., Huntington, 2009).

**Books and Reviews:**
- **"Arctic Climate Change, Economy and Society (ACIA)"** by the Arctic Council (2004) provides a comprehensive overview of the Arctic region, including environmental changes and socio-economic impacts.
