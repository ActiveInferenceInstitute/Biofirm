## Juan Fernández & Desventuradas Islands Bioregion (NT7) Analysis

The Juan Fernández Islands and Desventuradas Islands are remote archipelagos located off the coast of Chile, known for their unique biodiversity and fragile ecosystems. These islands are part of a larger ecoregion characterized by subtropical and tropical marine ecosystems, with a focus on their terrestrial components.

### 1. Ecological Characterization

#### Climate Patterns
The climate of the Juan Fernández Islands is generally mild and humid, with a strong maritime influence. The Desventuradas Islands, being more remote, experience a similar but slightly drier climate. These climate conditions support a variety of endemic species and unique ecosystems.

#### Key Biomes and Ecosystems
- **Terrestrial Ecosystems**: The islands host temperate rainforests, scrublands, and grasslands. The forests are dominated by endemic species such as the **Robinson Crusoe pine (Lomatia ferruginea)** and the **jujube tree (Lomatia hirsuta)**.
- **Marine Ecosystems**: The surrounding waters are rich in marine biodiversity, including coral reefs and kelp forests.

#### Dominant and Keystone Species
- **Endemic Species**: The Juan Fernández Islands are famous for their endemic species, such as the **Robinson Crusoe's fur seal (Arctophoca philippii)** and several bird species like the **Masafuera rayadito (Aphrastura masafuerae)**.
- **Keystone Species**: The **Juan Fernández fur seal** plays a crucial role in maintaining the marine ecosystem balance.

#### Seasonal Dynamics and Migration Patterns
- **Seasonal Variations**: The islands experience a mild seasonal variation, with no significant migrations recorded for terrestrial species. However, marine species may exhibit seasonal patterns influenced by ocean currents and temperature changes.
- **Migration Patterns**: Some marine species, like sea birds and whales, may use the surrounding waters during their migrations, but specific data on these patterns is limited.

### 2. Environmental Challenges

#### Climate Change Impacts
- **Sea Level Rise**: Rising sea levels pose a significant threat to coastal ecosystems and human settlements.
- **Temperature Changes**: Increased water temperatures may affect marine biodiversity, particularly coral reefs.
