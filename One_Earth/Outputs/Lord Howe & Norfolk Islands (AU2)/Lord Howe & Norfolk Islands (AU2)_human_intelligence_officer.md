## 8. Research Expectations and Gaps
### Comprehensive Responses
This analysis highlights key stakeholders and networks but also identifies several research gaps, particularly regarding emerging researchers, local community leaders, environmental activists, and specific philanthropic efforts in the region.

### Internet Research Limitations
Limited information was found regarding specific stakeholders and initiatives focused exclusively on Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands. This suggests a need for more targeted research efforts or direct outreach to local organizations and individuals.
