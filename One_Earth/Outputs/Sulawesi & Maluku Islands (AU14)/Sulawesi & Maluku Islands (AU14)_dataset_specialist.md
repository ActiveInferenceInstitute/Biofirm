### 7. Data Quality and Accessibility Assessment

**Data Completeness Evaluations:**
- Significant gaps in socio-ecological and environmental monitoring data.
- **Gap Example:** Limited hydrological monitoring data.

**Temporal Coverage Analysis:**
- Historical baselines exist, but continuous monitoring is sparse.

**Spatial Resolution Assessment:**
- High-resolution data available through remote sensing, but lower resolution for other datasets.

**Data Access Conditions:**
- Varies; some datasets require permission or have usage restrictions.

**Interoperability Status:**
- Integration challenges exist due to differing data formats and sources.

**Data Collection Methodologies and Quality Assurance Procedures:**
- Quality assurance practices are essential for ensuring reliable data.
