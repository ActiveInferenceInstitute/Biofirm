The Greater Yukon is located in a subarctic climate zone, characterized by long, cold winters and short, cool summers. This climate type significantly influences the regional ecosystems, supporting vegetation such as tundra, boreal forests, and alpine meadows.

### Key Biomes and Habitats
- **Boreal Forests (Taiga):** Dominant in the region, these forests are rich in coniferous species like spruce, fir, and aspen.
- **Tundra:** Found at higher elevations or latitudes, characterized by low-growing vegetation due to harsh climate conditions.
- **Alpine Meadows:** Support a variety of plant species adapted to high-altitude conditions.
- **Rivers and Wetlands:** Crucial for aquatic life and ecosystem services.

### Dominant and Keystone Species
- **Mammals:** Moose, caribou, wolves, and bears.
- **Birds:** Ptarmigan, grouse, and various waterfowl.
- **Fish:** Salmon and trout are key aquatic species.
- **Endemic Species:** Specific to the region, such as the Yukon subspecies of moose or caribou.

### Seasonal Dynamics and Migration Patterns
