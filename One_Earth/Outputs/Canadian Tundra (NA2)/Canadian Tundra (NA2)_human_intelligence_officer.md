## Bioregion Overview: Canadian Tundra (NA2)
The Canadian Tundra, part of the broader Arctic region, is characterized by vast, treeless plains and significant biodiversity despite its harsh climate. Key ecological challenges include climate change, habitat degradation, and conservation of wildlife such as polar bears and caribou. Economically, the region is rich in natural resources like oil, gas, and minerals, but faces challenges in balancing extraction activities with environmental protection. This analysis will map stakeholders across academia, government, NGOs, private sector, indigenous communities, and influential networks.
