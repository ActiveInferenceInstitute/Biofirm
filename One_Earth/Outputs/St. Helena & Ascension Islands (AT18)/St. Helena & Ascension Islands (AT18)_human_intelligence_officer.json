  "research_data": "## St. Helena & Ascension Islands (AT18) Bioregion Analysis\n\n### 1. ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH STAKEHOLDERS\n\nThe St. Helena & Ascension Islands bioregion has unique ecological systems, but detailed research on specific academic stakeholders in this area is limited. However, some organizations and initiatives are relevant for regional ecological studies:\n\n- **Research Institutions**: \n  - The St. Helena National Trust is involved in conservation efforts, though it may not be primarily focused on academic research.\n  - The Ascension Island Government supports some research through partnerships with international organizations[1].\n\n- **Collaborative Research Initiatives**: \n  - The South Atlantic Environmental Research Institute (SAERI) might have partnerships or research interests in this bioregion, though specific projects are not detailed in available sources.\n  - The UK-based Universities and research centers might collaborate on projects related to these islands due to historical ties.\n\n- **Emerging Researchers**: \n  - There is a need for more detailed research to identify emerging researchers in this specific bioregion.\n\n### 2. GOVERNMENTAL AND POLICY ACTORS\n\n- **Governmental Agencies**:\n  - **St. Helena Government**: Oversees local regulations and conservation efforts on the island.\n  - **Ascension Island Government**: Manages local affairs and environmental policies for Ascension Island.\n  - **UK Government**: Provides oversight and support as part of the British Overseas Territories.\n\n- **Policymakers and Officials**:\n  - The Governor of St. Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha plays a key role in policy implementation.\n  - Local council members in both St. Helena and Ascension Island influence policy decisions.\n\n- **Regulatory Bodies**:\n  - The Environmental Management Division under the St. Helena Government is responsible for conservation and environmental management.\n  - Ascension Island has its own environmental management structures within the government.\n\n- **Indigenous Governance**: \n  - There are no indigenous governance structures as the islands have no indigenous populations; however, local community organizations play significant roles.\n\n- **International Initiatives**:\n  - The UK's involvement in international environmental agreements can impact these islands.\n\n### 3. NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS\n\n- **Conservation NGOs**:\n  - The St. Helena National Trust is a local organization focused on conservation and heritage preservation.\n  - International organizations like the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) may have projects in the area due to its unique biodiversity.\n\n- **Community-Based Organizations**:\n  - Local community groups, though not extensively documented, likely play a role in environmental initiatives.\n\n- **Environmental Advocacy Groups**:\n  - The St. Helena Government sometimes partners with international NGOs for environmental projects.\n\n- **Funding Organizations**:\n  - The Darwin Initiative has supported conservation projects in the South Atlantic, which might include St. Helena and Ascension Islands.\n\n### 4. PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES\n\n- **Companies with Environmental Impact**:\n  - Fishing and tourism industries are significant in these islands, though specific companies are not well-documented.\n  - The St. Helena Government also oversees tourism development to ensure sustainability.\n\n- **Green Businesses**:\n  - There is a growing interest in sustainable tourism and renewable energy, but specific green businesses are not well-represented in available data.\n\n- **Sustainable Agriculture**:\n  - Local agriculture is primarily for domestic consumption, with some potential for sustainable practices.\n\n- **Ecotourism Operators**:\n  - Tourism is a significant sector, with efforts to maintain its sustainability.\n\n### 5. INDIGENOUS AND LOCAL COMMUNITY LEADERS\n\n- **Tribal Elders/Chiefs**: \n  - There are no indigenous populations on these islands, so there are no tribal elders or chiefs in the traditional sense.\n\n- **Community Organizers**:\n  - Local community leaders play a crucial role in mobilizing around environmental and social issues.\n\n- **Traditional Ecological Knowledge Practitioners**: \n  - Given the absence of indigenous populations, traditional ecological knowledge is not applicable in the same way as in regions with native communities.\n\n### 6. INFLUENTIAL INDIVIDUALS AND NETWORKS\n\n- **Environmental Activists**:\n  - Local activists often work through community organizations to advocate for environmental causes.\n\n- **Journalists and Media Figures**:\n  - Regional media outlets cover environmental issues, but specific influential journalists may not be well-documented.\n\n- **Social Media Influencers**:\n  - Social media influencers are not particularly prominent in environmental discussions specific to this bioregion.\n\n### 7. STAKEHOLDER NETWORK ANALYSIS\n\n- **Collaborative Partnerships**:\n  - Partnerships between local governments and international NGOs are crucial for conservation efforts.\n  - Community engagement is vital for successful environmental projects.\n\n- **Power Dynamics and Influence Relationships**:\n  - The UK Government and local island governments have significant influence over policy and resource allocation.\n\n- **Conflicts and Competing Interests**:\n  - Balancing economic development with environmental conservation is a common tension.\n\n- **Successful Multi-Stakeholder Initiatives**:\n  - Collaborations between government, NGOs, and local communities have been key to successful conservation projects.\n\n### Research Opportunities\n\n- **Detailed Academic Research**: There is a gap in identifying specific researchers focusing on this bioregion.\n- **Private Sector Entities**: More information is needed on companies and businesses contributing to sustainability in the region.\n- **Influential Individuals**: Identifying key environmental thought leaders and influencers in the region could enhance engagement strategies.\n\n### Bibliography\n\n1. *St. Helena National Trust*.
