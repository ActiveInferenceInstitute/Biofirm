  - The Ascension Island Government supports some research through partnerships with international organizations[1].

- **Collaborative Research Initiatives**: 
  - The South Atlantic Environmental Research Institute (SAERI) might have partnerships or research interests in this bioregion, though specific projects are not detailed in available sources.
  - The UK-based Universities and research centers might collaborate on projects related to these islands due to historical ties.

- **Emerging Researchers**: 
  - There is a need for more detailed research to identify emerging researchers in this specific bioregion.

### 2. GOVERNMENTAL AND POLICY ACTORS

- **Governmental Agencies**:
