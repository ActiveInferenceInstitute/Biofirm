### Bioregion: St. Helena & Ascension Islands (AT18)

**Overview:**
St. Helena and Ascension Islands are part of the South Atlantic Ocean's remote archipelagos. The bioregion's unique biodiversity, coupled with its isolated location, presents both ecological challenges and opportunities for research and conservation.

## 1. SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE MAPPING

### Peer-Reviewed Journal Articles and Books
- **Ecological Studies:** There is limited literature specific to the ecology of St. Helena and Ascension Islands compared to larger bioregions. However, studies often focus on unique species distributions and the impacts of invasive species on native biodiversity.
- **Conservation Efforts:** Recent publications highlight conservation efforts, such as the eradication of invasive species to protect endemic birds and other wildlife.
- **Historical Documentation:** Historical accounts provide insights into the islands' ecological past and human impact over time.

### Recent Publications
- A study published in 2020 focused on the conservation challenges faced by seabirds on Ascension Island, highlighting the need for integrated management strategies.
- Another recent publication discussed the genetic diversity of plant species on St. Helena, emphasizing the importance of conservation genetics in preserving endemic species.

## 2. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING DATASETS

### Long-term Ecological Monitoring
- **Climate Data:** The British Antarctic Survey provides some climate data, but comprehensive long-term monitoring is limited for these islands.
- **Hydrological and Soil Data:** Specific datasets on hydrology and soil monitoring are scarce, with most research focused on broader marine or terrestrial ecological trends.

### Remote Sensing Datasets
- **Land Cover and Change Detection:** Satellite imagery from platforms like NASA's Landsat or the European Space Agency's Copernicus program can provide insights into land cover changes, though specific datasets might not be readily available for these islands.

## 3. BIODIVERSITY AND SPECIES DATA

### Species Inventories and Protected Species Data
- **Endemic Species:** St. Helena and Ascension Islands are known for their unique endemic species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) provides data on protected species, including the near-extinct St. Helena plover and the Ascension Island frigatebird.
- **Natural History Collections:** The Natural History Museum in London holds significant collections related to the islands, including botanical and zoological specimens.

### Citizen Science Initiatives
- Citizen science projects are limited in this bioregion due to its remote nature, but local initiatives may exist through island communities or conservation groups.

## 4. LAND USE AND CONSERVATION DATASETS

### Protected Areas and Management Plans
- **Protected Areas:** St. Helena National Trust manages several protected areas, but detailed datasets on these areas are sparse.
- **Land Use Change:** Historical land use changes can be inferred from historical records, but specific datasets on recent changes might be lacking.

## 5. SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL DATASETS

### Socioeconomic Data and Environmental Justice
- **Economic Landscape:** The economy is largely based on fishing and tourism. Socioeconomic data is limited but can be accessed through government reports or international databases.
- **Environmental Justice:** There is a lack of specific research on environmental justice in this bioregion.

## 6. DATA REPOSITORIES AND RESOURCES

### Institutional Repositories and Government Portals
- **Government Data Portals:** The Government of St. Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha provides some environmental data, but it is often not comprehensive or publicly accessible in a structured format.
- **International Initiatives:** Global biodiversity databases like the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) offer some data on species distributions in the region.

### Citizen Science Platforms
- Citizen science platforms are not well-represented in this bioregion, though local community efforts might contribute to broader biodiversity initiatives.

## 7. DATA QUALITY AND ACCESSIBILITY ASSESSMENT

### Data Completeness and Accessibility
- **Completeness:** There is a significant lack of comprehensive datasets across all categories, particularly in environmental monitoring and socio-ecological data.
- **Accessibility:** Much of the available data is not easily accessible or is scattered across various institutions, limiting its usability for research.

### Priority Data Collection Needs
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Establishing long-term ecological monitoring programs for climate, hydrology, and biodiversity would be crucial.
- **Socio-ecological Data:** Collecting socioeconomic data and integrating it with ecological research to understand human impact on the environment.

## 8. RESEARCH EXPECTATIONS

### Emerging Research Directions
- **Conservation Biology:** Future research should focus on integrated conservation strategies that address both native species protection and invasive species management.
- **Sustainable Development:** Studies on sustainable economic development that align with environmental conservation goals are essential.

### Information Gaps
- **Comprehensive Environmental Monitoring:** There is a significant need for long-term datasets on climate, hydrology, and soil health.
- **Socioeconomic and Socio-ecological Data:** Integrating socioeconomic data with ecological research is crucial but currently lacking.

This analysis highlights the need for more comprehensive data collection and accessibility in the St. Helena & Ascension Islands bioregion to support conservation and sustainable development efforts.
