## 8. Research Expectations

Given the limitations in available data, several research opportunities exist to further map stakeholders in Cape Verde:

1. **Emerging Researchers:** Identifying young scientists contributing to regional ecological knowledge.
2. **Community-Based Organizations:** Documenting local environmental initiatives and their leadership.
3. **Indigenous and Local Community Leaders:** Understanding traditional ecological practices and community organizers.
4. **Influential Individuals:** Identifying environmental thought leaders and media figures.

Creating detailed organizational charts and stakeholder maps requires more specific data on these actors and their networks.
