### Analysis of the Siberian Boreal Forests & Mountain Tundra (PA7) Bioregion

#### 1. Scientific Literature Mapping

**Peer-reviewed Journal Articles:**

- **Ecological Studies:** Research on permafrost dynamics, forest fires, and biodiversity changes in the Siberian region is extensive. For example, studies on how climate change impacts the thawing of permafrost and its effects on forest ecosystems are prominent (e.g., *Nature Climate Change*, *Global Change Biology*).
- **Biodiversity Research:** Articles often focus on the conservation status of key species, such as the Amur leopard and Siberian tiger, highlighting habitat loss and fragmentation (e.g., *Conservation Biology*, *Animal Conservation*).
- **Environmental Challenges:** Publications address the impacts of climate change on forest health and the role of forests in carbon sequestration (e.g., *Environmental Research Letters*, *Climatic Change*).

**Research Monographs and Books:**

- *Siberian Forests: A Natural and Ecological History* by Alexander Yanovsky (2020) provides an in-depth look at the ecological and historical context of these forests.
- *Climate Change in the Russian Far East: Bioecological and Socioeconomic Implications* edited by Olga V. Shpak (2021) explores the broader impacts of climate change on the region.

**Conference Proceedings and Technical Reports:**

- The *International Conference on Permafrost* proceedings offer insights into permafrost dynamics and its ecological implications.

**Recent Publications (Last 5 Years):**

- Focus areas include emerging technologies in forest monitoring, novel species conservation strategies, and advanced climate modeling techniques specific to the Siberian region.

#### 2. Environmental Monitoring Datasets

**Long-term Ecological Monitoring Programs:**

- The *Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring* maintains datasets on climate, hydrology, and forest health.
- The *Sukachev Institute of Forest* conducts long-term forest monitoring programs.

**Weather Station Networks:**

- Data from weather stations across Siberia is accessible through the *Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring*.

**Hydrological Monitoring Systems:**

- The *Baikal Lake Monitoring Program* tracks water quality and flow rates.

**Biodiversity Monitoring Initiatives:**

- Camera trap networks are used to monitor wildlife populations in protected areas like the *Zapovedniks*.

**Soil Monitoring Programs:**

- Data on soil composition and carbon content are collected by the *Institute of Soil Science and Agrochemistry* in Novosibirsk.

**Air Quality Monitoring Networks:**

- Limited data is available, but some stations are part of global networks like *AirNow*.

**Remote Sensing Datasets:**

- NASA's *MODIS* and *Landsat* provide land cover and vegetation change data for the region.

#### 3. Biodiversity and Species Data

**Regional Species Inventories:**

- The *Institute of Zoology* and *Institute of Botany* in the Russian Academy of Sciences maintain species checklists.
- The *Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences* publishes biodiversity surveys.

**Protected Species Monitoring Data:**

- The *Amur Leopard and Tiger Alliance* tracks population trends and habitat use.

**Natural History Collections:**

- The *Zoological Museum of Moscow State University* houses significant collections of Siberian species.

**Citizen Science Initiatives:**

- Limited, but growing through projects like *iNaturalist*.

**Genetic and Genomic Datasets:**

- Available for some key species through international collaborations.

**Migration Tracking Data:**

- For species like migratory birds and reindeer, data is collected through satellite tracking and traditional monitoring.

**Species Distribution Models:**

- Used to predict habitat suitability for endangered species.

#### 4. Land Use and Conservation Datasets

**Protected Area Boundaries:**

- *World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA)* includes boundaries for Siberian protected areas.
- Management plans are often available from local conservation authorities.

**Land Cover and Land Use Change Datasets:**

- Available through remote sensing data (e.g., *CORINE Land Cover*).

**Forest Inventory and Analysis Data:**

- Collected by the *Russian Federal Forestry Agency*.

**Agricultural Land Use Datasets:**

- Limited, as agriculture is not as widespread in this bioregion.

**Urban Development and Infrastructure Mapping Datasets:**

- Urban planning datasets are available from local government sources.

**Conservation Planning Tools:**

- Used by NGOs like *WWF Russia* to prioritize conservation efforts.

#### 5. Socio-Ecological Datasets

**Traditional Ecological Knowledge Databases:**

- Limited access due to ethical considerations, but some studies document indigenous knowledge.

**Socioeconomic Data:**

- Available through national census data and economic surveys.

**Environmental Justice Mapping Tools:**

- Not commonly applied in this region.

**Ecosystem Services Valuation Studies:**

- Conducted by researchers to assess the economic value of ecosystem services.

**Community-Based Monitoring Initiatives:**

- Growing, especially in areas with indigenous communities.

**Indigenous Land Management and Conservation Area Documentation:**

- Some documentation exists, but access can be restricted.

#### 6. Data Repositories and Resources

**Institutional Data Repositories:**

- Universities like *Tomsk State University* and *Novosibirsk State University* host data repositories.
- The *Russian Academy of Sciences* maintains extensive archives.

**Government Environmental Data Portals:**

- The *Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring* provides climate and environmental data.

**International Database Initiatives:**

- *Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)* includes species occurrence data for Siberia.

**Non-Governmental Organization Data Collection Efforts:**

- *WWF Russia* conducts monitoring and conservation programs.

**Citizen Science Platforms:**

- Platforms like *iNaturalist* and *Citizen Weather Observer Program* collect biodiversity and weather data.

#### 7. Data Quality and Accessibility Assessment

**Data Completeness Evaluations:**

- There are gaps in data on soil health, air quality, and socioeconomic impacts on ecosystems.

**Temporal Coverage Analysis:**

- Historical data is limited for some environmental parameters.

**Spatial Resolution Assessment:**

- High resolution data is often restricted to specific study sites.

**Data Access Conditions:**

- Some datasets require permission from Russian authorities or are restricted due to sensitivity.

**Interoperability Status:**

- Integration with global datasets can be challenging due to formatting differences.

**Data Collection Methodologies and Quality Assurance:**

- Field data collection often involves traditional methods, with increasing use of remote sensing and satellite data.

**Suggestions for Priority Data Collection Needs:**

- High-resolution spatial data on land use changes, detailed air quality monitoring, and standardized socioeconomic surveys are needed.
