Research Expectations\n\n#### Emerging Research Directions\n- **Climate Change Impacts**: Ongoing research focuses on modeling and predicting climate change effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services.\n- **Sustainable Forest Management**: Studies on sustainable forest practices and their impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.\n\n#### Bibliography\n\n- **Abell, R., M.

Addressing these gaps will enhance research and conservation efforts in the region.",
