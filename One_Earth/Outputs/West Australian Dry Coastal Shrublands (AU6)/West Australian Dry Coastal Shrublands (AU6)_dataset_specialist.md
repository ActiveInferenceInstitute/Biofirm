## Scientific Literature Mapping

### Peer-reviewed Journal Articles

Articles specifically focusing on the West Australian Dry Coastal Shrublands (AU6) are limited, but publications related to broader Western Australian ecosystems can provide insights. Themes include biodiversity, fire ecology, and climate change impacts.

- **Biodiversity and Conservation**: Studies on Western Australia often focus on broader regions like the Southwest Australian Floristic Region, which includes the dry shrublands. These studies highlight high endemism and conservation challenges due to habitat fragmentation and climate change (e.g., [Barrett et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128000252000074)).
  
- **Fire Ecology**: Fire plays a significant role in Australian ecosystems. Research covers fire regimes, fire ecology, and the impact on vegetation and wildlife (e.g., [Burrows et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012800025200013X)).

- **Climate Change**: Papers on climate change impacts in Western Australia often address broader regional effects, including increased aridity and altered fire regimes, affecting biodiversity and ecosystem resilience (e.g., [Hughes et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X17001365)).
