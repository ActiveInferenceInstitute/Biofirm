### Introduction to the Northern Sahara Deserts, Savannas & Marshes Bioregion (PA24)

The Northern Sahara Deserts, Savannas & Marshes bioregion (PA24) encompasses vast areas across North Africa, including parts of Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, and Tunisia. This region is characterized by arid deserts, semi-arid savannas, and unique wetland ecosystems, hosting diverse flora and fauna adapted to these harsh conditions. Ecological challenges include desertification, water scarcity, and climate change impacts, while economic activities range from traditional agriculture to oil and gas extraction.
