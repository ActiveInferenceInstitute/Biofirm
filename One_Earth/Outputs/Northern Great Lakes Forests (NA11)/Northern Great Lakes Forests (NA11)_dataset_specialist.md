- **University of Michigan's ICPSR:** Hosts a wide range of environmental and social datasets relevant to the Great Lakes region.

**Government Data Portals:**

- **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):** Provides access to environmental data and monitoring reports for the region.

### 7. Data Quality and Accessibility Assessment

**Data Completeness:**

- Gaps exist in long-term biodiversity monitoring, particularly for certain species groups.
  
**Temporal Coverage:**

- Historical climate data is well-documented, but there is a need for more recent ecological monitoring data.

**Spatial Resolution:**

- High-resolution land cover data is available, but biodiversity data often lacks fine-scale spatial detail.

### 8. Research Expectations and Future Directions

**Emerging Research Directions:**

- **Climate Change Impacts:** Investigating the effects of climate change on forest ecosystems and biodiversity in the Great Lakes region.
  
**New Findings:**

- Recent studies highlight the importance of adaptive forest management strategies in response to changing environmental conditions.

**Notes on Data Gaps and Future Directions:**

1. **Long-term Biodiversity Monitoring:** There is a need for more comprehensive long-term monitoring of biodiversity in the Great Lakes forests to better understand ecological trends and responses to environmental changes.
   
2. **Spatial Resolution:** Fine-scale spatial data on biodiversity and land use changes would enhance the ability to model and predict ecological processes at the local level.

3. **Climate Change Research:** Further research is needed to understand the impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems and biodiversity in the Northern Great Lakes region.
