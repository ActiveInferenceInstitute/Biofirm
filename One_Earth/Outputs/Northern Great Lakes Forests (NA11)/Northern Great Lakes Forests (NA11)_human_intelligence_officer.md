## Bioregion Analysis: Northern Great Lakes Forests (NA11)

The Northern Great Lakes Forests bioregion encompasses a vast area of mixed hardwood and coniferous forests across the northern United States and southern Canada. This region is rich in biodiversity and natural resources, but it faces environmental challenges such as climate change, invasive species, and land use pressures. The analysis below maps key stakeholders and actors across various sectors.
