Research Expectations and Future Directions\n\n**Emerging Research Directions:**\n\n- **Climate Change Impacts:** Investigating the effects of climate change on forest ecosystems and biodiversity in the Great Lakes region.\n  \n**New Findings:**\n\n- Recent studies highlight the importance of adaptive forest management strategies in response to changing environmental conditions.\n\n### Dataset Catalog\n\n| Dataset Type | Dataset Name | Source | Temporal Coverage | Spatial Resolution | Access Conditions |\n|-------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| Ecological Monitoring | NEON Data | NEON | 2014-present | Local to regional scales | Public access |\n| Climate Data | NCEI Records | NCEI | 1950-present | County to national scales | Public access |\n| Biodiversity Monitoring | eBird Data | eBird | 2002-present | Point locations | Public access |\n| Species Inventories | NatureServe Data | NatureServe | Ongoing | Species-specific | Public access |\n| Land Use Change | NLCD Data | USGS | 2001-present | 30-meter resolution | Public access |\n\n### Bibliography\n\n1. **Fry, J.
