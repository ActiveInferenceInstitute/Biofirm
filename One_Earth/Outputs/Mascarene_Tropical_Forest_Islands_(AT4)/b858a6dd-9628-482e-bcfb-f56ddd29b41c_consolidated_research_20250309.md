### Introduction to the Mascarene Tropical Forest Islands (AT4) Bioregion

The Mascarene Islands, located in the Indian Ocean, include Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues. This bioregion is characterized by a unique biodiversity shaped by its tropical climate and volcanic origins. The islands are part of the Indo-Pacific region and host a variety of ecosystems, including tropical rainforests, coastal wetlands, and coral reefs.

### 1. Ecological Characterization

#### Climate Patterns
The Mascarene Islands experience a tropical monsoon climate, with high temperatures and rainfall throughout the year. The climate is influenced by the southeast trade winds, which bring significant rainfall to the islands, particularly Réunion and Mauritius. This climate supports a diverse range of plant and animal species.

#### Key Biomes and Ecosystems
- **Tropical Rainforests**: These forests are rich in biodiversity and host many endemic species. However, they are threatened due to habitat loss and invasive species.
- **Coastal Wetlands**: Important for marine biodiversity and serve as nurseries for fish and other aquatic species.
- **Coral Reefs**: Surround the islands and provide crucial ecosystem services, including shoreline protection and fisheries support.

#### Dominant and Keystone Species
- **Endemic Plants**: Species like the *Tambourissa_ spp.* and *Sideroxylon grandiflorum* are unique to the region.
- **Animals**: The Mauritius pink pigeon, Réunion parakeet, and the giant tortoise are iconic species, though many are endangered.

#### Seasonal Ecological Dynamics
Seasonal changes are minimal due to the tropical climate, but migration patterns of marine species like whales and dolphins occur during certain months.

### 2. Environmental Challenges

#### Climate Change Impacts
- **Temperature Rise**: Expected to increase, affecting biodiversity and ecosystems.
- **Sea Level Rise**: Threatens coastal ecosystems and infrastructure.

#### Land Use Changes
