Conducting a comprehensive analysis on the Marquesas Tropical Islands (OC2) requires extensive research across various sectors. However, due to the specific nature of the task and the lack of detailed information available online, this analysis will focus on general categories and highlight potential research areas.

## 1. **Academic and Research Stakeholders**

### Leading Researchers and Institutions
- **Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD)**: Often conducts research in French Polynesia, including ecological studies that could be relevant to the Marquesas.
- **French National Research Agency (ANR)**: May fund projects related to biodiversity and sustainability in the region.
- **University of French Polynesia**: Engages in local ecological research and could have faculty members focused on the Marquesas.

### Emerging Researchers and Networks
- **Local University Collaborations**: Emerging researchers might be part of collaborative efforts between local universities and international institutions.
- **Research Consortia**: Partnerships with international organizations could be crucial for advancing ecological knowledge in the region.

**Research Opportunities**: Identifying specific researchers and collaborative networks focused on the Marquesas requires deeper access to academic databases and local research publications.

## 2. **Governmental and Policy Actors**

### Relevant Government Agencies
- **French Polynesian Government**: Oversees environmental policies and regulations in the region.
- **French Ministry of the Environment**: May have influence through national policies.
- **Local Municipalities in the Marquesas**: Manage local environmental issues and conservation efforts.
