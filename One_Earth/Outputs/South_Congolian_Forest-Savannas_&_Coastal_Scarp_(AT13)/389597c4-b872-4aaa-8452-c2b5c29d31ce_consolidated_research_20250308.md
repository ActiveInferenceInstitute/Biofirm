## Bioregion Analysis: South Congolian Forest-Savannas & Coastal Scarp (AT13)

### ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION

**Climate Patterns and Their Impact on Regional Ecosystems:**
- The South Congolian Forest-Savannas & Coastal Scarp bioregion experiences a tropical humid climate with two distinct seasons: a wet season and a dry season. This seasonal pattern influences the growth and development of vegetation, with forests thriving during the wet season and experiencing stress during the dry season.
- Precipitation varies significantly across the region, with some areas receiving over 1,200 mm annually, contributing to the rich biodiversity and diverse ecosystems.

**Key Biomes, Habitats, and Ecosystems:**
- **Forests:** The region includes dense tropical forests, which are crucial for biodiversity and carbon sequestration. These forests are home to a variety of plant and animal species, many of which are endemic.
- **Savannas:** Mixed with forests, savannas provide habitats for a range of wildlife and support diverse agricultural practices.
- **Coastal Ecosystems:** Mangroves and coastal forests play a vital role in shoreline protection and marine biodiversity.

**Dominant and Keystone Plant and Animal Species:**
- **Plants:** Tropical hardwoods, such as mahogany and iroko, are dominant in forests. Mangroves are key species in coastal ecosystems.
- **Animals:** Large mammals like elephants, giraffes, and antelopes are keystone species in savannas. Forests are home to monkeys and birds, including parrots and hornbills.

**Seasonal Ecological Dynamics and Migration Patterns:**
- Seasonal drying of savannas prompts migrations among large herbivores towards more verdant areas.
- Birds and insects migrate seasonally between forests and coastal areas in search of food and suitable habitats.

### ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES

**Climate Change Impacts:**
- Rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns affect forest productivity and increase fire risk in savannas.
- Projected changes are likely to exacerbate droughts, further stressing ecosystems and biodiversity.

**Land Use Changes and Deforestation Rates:**
- Expanding agriculture and logging activities lead to high deforestation rates, threatening habitat integrity and biodiversity.
- Habitat fragmentation isolates populations, reducing genetic diversity.

**Water Security Issues:**
- Groundwater depletion occurs due to increased agricultural and urban demand.
- Pollution from agricultural runoff and industrial activities affects water quality.

**Soil Degradation Issues:**
