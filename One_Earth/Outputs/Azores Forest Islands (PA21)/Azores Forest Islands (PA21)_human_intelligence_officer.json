  "research_data": "Given the lack of specific data and search results related to the Azores Forest Islands (PA21) bioregion, the following analysis will provide a structured approach to identifying potential stakeholders and networks based on general knowledge and principles of stakeholder mapping. It will highlight areas where further research is needed to fill gaps in information.\n\n## 1. Academic and Research Stakeholders\n\n### Leading Researchers and Institutions\n- **Universidade dos Açores (University of the Azores)**: As a primary institution in the region, it likely hosts researchers focused on the local ecology and sustainability. Key researchers might include those in departments like biology, environmental science, or geography.\n- **Research Centers**: There may be specialized research centers focused on marine biology, forestry, or environmental studies given the unique biodiversity of the Azores.\n\n### Emerging Voices and Collaborative Initiatives\n- Emerging researchers might be involved in projects related to climate change, biodiversity conservation, or sustainable agriculture.\n- Collaborative initiatives could include partnerships with international organizations like the European Union's Horizon Europe program or local initiatives focused on renewable energy and sustainable development.\n\n**Research Opportunities**: Identify specific researchers at the University of the Azores and other institutions, and explore any collaborative research initiatives they are involved in.\n\n## 2. Governmental and Policy Actors\n\n### Governmental Agencies and Policymakers\n- **Regional Government of the Azores**: Responsible for environmental policies, conservation efforts, and resource management at a regional level.\n- **Portuguese Government Agencies**: Federal-level agencies such as the Ministry of Environment and Climate Action may have jurisdiction over national environmental policies affecting the Azores.\n\n### Regulatory Bodies and Indigenous Governance\n- **Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente (APA)**: While not exclusively focused on the Azores, this agency is responsible for environmental management at a national level.\n- **Indigenous Governance**: The Azores does not have indigenous peoples in the classical sense, but there may be local community structures involved in environmental decision-making.\n\n**Research Opportunities**: Detail the specific roles of regional and national agencies in environmental governance and identify any local community structures involved in decision-making.\n\n## 3.
