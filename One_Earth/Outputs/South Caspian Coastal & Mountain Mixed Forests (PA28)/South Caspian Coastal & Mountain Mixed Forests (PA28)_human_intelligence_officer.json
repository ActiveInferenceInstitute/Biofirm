  "research_data": "## Analysis of the South Caspian Coastal & Mountain Mixed Forests (PA28) Bioregion\n\nThe South Caspian Coastal & Mountain Mixed Forests bioregion, covering parts of Iran, Azerbaijan, and Russia, is a critical ecological area with diverse biodiversity and environmental challenges. This analysis will focus on the regional ecological systems, environmental challenges, economic landscape, regulatory environment, potential for sustainable biotech development, and local resources and infrastructure.\n\n### 1. Academic and Research Stakeholders\n\n- **Leading Researchers and Institutions**: \n  - **University of Tehran**: Known for its environmental and ecological research, particularly in the Caspian region.\n  - **Azerbaijan State University**: Conducts research on biodiversity and conservation in the region.\n  - **Lomonosov Moscow State University**: Engages in ecological studies across various bioregions, including the Caspian region.\n\n- **Collaborative Research Initiatives**:\n  - **Caspian Environment Programme (CEP)**: A regional initiative that involves research institutions from Iran, Azerbaijan, and Russia, focusing on environmental protection and sustainable development.\n  - **International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)**: Although not exclusively focused on the Caspian region, IUCN collaborates with local institutions on biodiversity conservation.\n\n- **Emerging Researchers**:\n  - Emerging researchers in this bioregion often focus on topics such as forest conservation, biodiversity, and climate change impacts. However, specific names and contributions are not readily available without detailed access to academic publications from the region.\n\n### 2. Governmental and Policy Actors\n\n- **Relevant Agencies**:\n  - **Iranian Department of Environment (DOE)**: Oversees environmental policies in Iran, including those affecting the Caspian region.\n  - **Azerbaijan Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources**: Responsible for environmental regulation and conservation efforts in Azerbaijan.\n  - **Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resource Use (Rosprirodnadzor)**: Manages environmental oversight in Russia, including the Caspian coastal areas.\n\n- **Key Policymakers**:\n  - Specific policymakers are not easily identified without up-to-date government directories. However, environment ministers and deputy ministers in each country play crucial roles.\n\n- **Regulatory Bodies**:\n  - **Caspian Sea Convention**: An international agreement between Caspian littoral states addressing environmental concerns and resource management.\n  \n- **Indigenous Governance Structures**: \n  - In the Caspian region, indigenous governance structures are less prominent compared to other bioregions.
