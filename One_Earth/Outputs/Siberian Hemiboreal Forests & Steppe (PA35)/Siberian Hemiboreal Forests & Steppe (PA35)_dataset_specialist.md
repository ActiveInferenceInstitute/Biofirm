**Community-Based Monitoring Initiatives:**

- Participatory research with local communities might focus on monitoring forest health and wildlife populations.

**Indigenous Land Management and Conservation Area Documentation:**

- Documentation of indigenous land use practices and conservation areas could be compiled by indigenous organizations.

### 6. DATA REPOSITORIES AND RESOURCES

**Institutional Data Repositories:**

- The Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences hosts several research centers with relevant datasets.

**Government Environmental Data Portals:**

- The Russian Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment provides access to environmental data and reports.
