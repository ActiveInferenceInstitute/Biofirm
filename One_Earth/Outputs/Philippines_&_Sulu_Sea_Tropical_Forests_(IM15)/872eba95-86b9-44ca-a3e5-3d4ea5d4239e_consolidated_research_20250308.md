## ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION

### Climate Patterns
The Philippines is characterized by a tropical climate with high temperatures and high levels of humidity throughout the year. The region experiences a pronounced rainy season from June to October and a dry season from November to May. Climatic conditions vary slightly across different islands due to geographical factors such as elevation and coastal influences.

### Key Biomes, Habitats, and Ecosystems
- **Tropical Rainforests**: Dominant in the Philippines, these forests are rich in biodiversity, hosting a wide variety of plant and animal species.
- **Mangroves**: Important coastal ecosystems that provide habitat for marine species and protect against natural hazards like typhoons.
- **Coral Reefs**: Abundant in the Sulu Sea, these ecosystems support a vast array of marine life.
- **Montane Ecosystems**: Found in higher elevations, these ecosystems are home to unique, often endemic species.

### Dominant and Keystone Species
- **Philippine Eagle**: A keystone species and a symbol of the country's biodiversity.
- **Tarsier**: An endemic primate found in parts of the Philippines.
- **Dugong**: Found in coastal waters, this marine mammal is a key species in marine ecosystems.

### Seasonal Ecological Dynamics
- **Migration Patterns**: Some species migrate in response to seasonal changes, especially in montane ecosystems where temperature and humidity shifts are more pronounced.
- **Breeding Seasons**: Many marine species have specific breeding seasons, often tied to lunar cycles and water conditions.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES

### Climate Change Impacts
- **Rising Sea Levels**: Threaten coastal ecosystems and communities.
