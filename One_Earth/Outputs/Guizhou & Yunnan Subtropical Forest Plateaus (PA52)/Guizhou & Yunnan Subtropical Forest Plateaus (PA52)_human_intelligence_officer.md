### Research Expectations and Challenges

Conducting comprehensive research in the Guizhou & Yunnan Subtropical Forest Plateaus bioregion presents several challenges:

1. **Information Availability:** Limited access to detailed, up-to-date information on emerging researchers and local community leaders.
2. **Geographic Scope:** The vastness of the bioregion makes it difficult to cover all regions effectively.
3. **Stakeholder Mapping:** Creating detailed stakeholder maps requires extensive data on relationships and influence levels among stakeholders.
