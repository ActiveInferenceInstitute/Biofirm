### Bioregion Overview: Hawai’i Tropical Islands (OC11)
The Hawai’i Tropical Islands bioregion is characterized by unique biodiversity and ecological challenges due to its remote location and fragile ecosystems. This analysis focuses on the key aspects of regional ecological systems, biodiversity, environmental challenges, economic landscape, regulatory environment, and potential for sustainable development.

## 1. Scientific Literature Mapping

### Peer-Reviewed Journal Articles
- **Ecological Research**: Hawai’i is known for its high endemism and biodiversity. Studies focus on the impacts of invasive species and climate change on native ecosystems (e.g., *Journal of Ecology*, *Conservation Biology*) [1][3].
- **Environmental Challenges**: Articles in *Environmental Conservation* and *Journal of Applied Ecology* highlight issues like habitat destruction and erosion[1][3].
- **Recent Publications**: Recent studies (last 5 years) have explored sustainable agriculture practices and renewable energy development on the islands (*Renewable Energy* and *Agricultural Systems*) [1][3].

### Monographs and Books
- **"Hawaiian Natural History, Ecology, and Evolution"** by Alan C. Ziegler: A comprehensive overview of Hawai’i's natural history, focusing on evolution and ecological systems.
