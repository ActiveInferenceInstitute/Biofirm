Given the specific focus on the Guam & Marianas Dry Tropical Islands (OC9) bioregion, I'll provide a detailed analysis based on available information. However, due to the limited specific data found in the initial search results, I will rely on general knowledge and provide a structured framework for further research.

## 1. ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH STAKEHOLDERS
- **Leading Researchers and Institutions**: 
  - The University of Guam is a key institution, with research focus areas including marine science, ecology, and sustainability. Researchers like Dr. Peter Houk are well-known for their work in marine conservation and ecological studies.
  - The Guam Environmental Protection Agency (GEPA) collaborates with academic institutions on environmental research projects.

- **Emerging Researchers**: 
  - New researchers and graduate students from the University of Guam and other regional institutions are contributing to local ecological studies, though specific names might require further investigation.

## 2. GOVERNMENTAL AND POLICY ACTORS
- **Government Agencies**: 
  - **Guam Environmental Protection Agency (GEPA)**: Oversees environmental policies and regulations on the island.
  - **U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service**: Plays a role in conservation efforts in the region.
  - **Department of Agriculture, Government of Guam**: Manages land use and agricultural practices.

- **Policymakers and Officials**: 
  - The Governor of Guam and local senators often have roles in environmental policy-making.
  - The Guam Legislature's Committee on Natural Resources and Environmental Protection handles related legislation.

- **Indigenous Governance**: 
  - The Chamorro Land Trust Commission is involved in land management decisions affecting indigenous communities.

## 3. NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS
- **Conservation NGOs**: 
  - **Guam Audubon Society**: Focuses on bird conservation and habitat protection.
  - **The Nature Conservancy**: Has projects in the region aimed at marine conservation and ecosystem management.

- **Community-Based Organizations**: 
  - **Guam Community Coral Reef Monitoring Program**: Engages local communities in coral reef conservation.
  - **Guam Environmental Education Initiative**: Promotes environmental awareness among local communities.

## 4. PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES
- **Companies with Environmental Impact**:
  - **IT&E**: A telecommunications company with operations in Guam, which may impact local infrastructure.
  - **Guam Power Authority**: Manages energy resources and has implications for environmental sustainability.

- **Green Businesses**:
  - **Local sustainable agriculture initiatives**: Such as the Guam Farmers' Cooperative, which promotes organic farming practices.

- **Ecotourism Operators**:
  - **Pacific Islands Club Guam**: Offers eco-friendly tourism experiences.

## 5. INDIGENOUS AND LOCAL COMMUNITY LEADERS
- **Tribal Elders and Knowledge Keepers**:
  - Leaders from the Chamorro community, such as Maga’låhi (chiefs), play significant roles in cultural preservation and traditional ecological knowledge.

- **Community Organizers**:
  - Activists involved in environmental justice movements, such as those advocating for protection of ancestral lands.

## 6. INFLUENTIAL INDIVIDUALS AND NETWORKS
- **Environmental Activists**:
  - Local figures like Lou Leon Guerrero, the Governor of Guam, who has been involved in environmental policy discussions.

- **Journalists and Media Figures**:
  - Reporters from the *Guam Daily Post* and other local media outlets covering environmental issues.

## 7. STAKEHOLDER NETWORK ANALYSIS
- **Collaborative Partnerships**:
  - Partnerships between government agencies, NGOs, and local communities are crucial for environmental projects in Guam. For example, collaborations between the Guam Environmental Protection Agency and The Nature Conservancy.

- **Power Dynamics**:
  - Government agencies often hold significant influence due to their regulatory powers, while NGOs and local communities may influence through advocacy and grassroots movements.

## 8. RESEARCH EXPECTATIONS
- Further research should focus on detailed organizational charts and stakeholder maps visualizing the network dynamics. Specific names and contact details for key stakeholders would require direct outreach or access to local directories. A comprehensive bibliography should include local reports, academic studies, and news articles.

### Comprehensive Bibliography:
- For a detailed bibliography, it would be essential to compile reports from local government agencies, academic research papers focused on Guam's ecology, and news articles covering environmental issues in the region. However, specific sources are not listed here due to the lack of direct search results.

### Research Opportunities:
- Identifying specific emerging researchers and their contributions to regional knowledge.
- Detailed analysis of indigenous governance structures and their role in environmental management.
- A thorough examination of local community-based initiatives and their impact on environmental conservation.

This analysis provides a foundational framework for understanding key stakeholders in the Guam & Marianas Dry Tropical Islands bioregion. Further research is needed to fill gaps and provide specific details on emerging voices and grassroots initiatives.
