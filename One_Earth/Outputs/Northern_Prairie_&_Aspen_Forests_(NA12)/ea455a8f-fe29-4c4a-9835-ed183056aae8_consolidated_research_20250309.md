## ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION

### Climate Patterns and Ecosystems
- **Climate**: The region experiences a continental climate with cold winters and warm summers, influencing the types of vegetation and wildlife that thrive here. The climate varies significantly across the prairies and forests, impacting seasonal migration patterns of species[4].
- **Biomes and Habitats**: The bioregion includes temperate grasslands and deciduous forests, notably aspen forests. These ecosystems support a variety of flora and fauna adapted to the region's climate variability.
- **Dominant Species**: Key plant species include aspen trees (*Populus tremuloides*) and various native grasses. Animal species like bison (*Bison bison*) and prairie dogs (*Cynomys ludovicianus*) are integral to the ecosystem dynamics.
- **Seasonal Dynamics**: Seasonal changes drive migration and hibernation patterns among local wildlife. For instance, birds migrate to warmer areas during winter, while mammals like bears hibernate[4].

## ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES

### Climate Change Impacts
