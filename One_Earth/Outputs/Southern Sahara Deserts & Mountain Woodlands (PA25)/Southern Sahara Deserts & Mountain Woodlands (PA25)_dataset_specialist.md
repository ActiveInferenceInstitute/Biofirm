- **Species Distribution Models and Habitat Suitability Datasets**: 
  These models predict how climate change affects desert species distributions.

### 4. Land Use and Conservation Datasets

- **Protected Area Boundaries**: 
  The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) provides spatial data on protected areas within the Sahara.

- **Land Cover and Land Use Change Datasets**: 
  Data from the Global Land Cover Network (GLCN) track changes in land use and habitat conversion.

- **Forest Inventory and Analysis Data**: 
  Although less applicable to deserts, forest data can inform on nearby woodland areas.

- **Agricultural Land Use Datasets**: 
  Data on agricultural practices in oases and irrigated areas are essential for understanding land use impacts.
