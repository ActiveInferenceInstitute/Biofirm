**Spatial Resolution Assessment**:
- Spatial resolution varies widely among datasets; remote sensing data often have high resolution, while some biodiversity surveys may have coarser resolutions.

**Data Access Conditions and Licensing**:
- Access conditions vary; some datasets are openly available (e.g., Copernicus), while others require permission or subscription (e.g., certain research databases).

**Interoperability and Compatibility**:
- Interoperability is generally good for datasets using standard formats (e.g., shapefiles), but integrating datasets from different sources can be challenging.

**Data Collection Methodologies and Quality Assurance**:
- Methodologies are well-documented for most datasets, but quality assurance processes can vary.

**Suggestions for Priority Data Collection Needs**:
- High-resolution soil monitoring and socioeconomic surveys are key areas for future data collection to address current gaps.
