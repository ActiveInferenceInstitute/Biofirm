**Biodiversity Monitoring Initiatives:**
- **Camera trap data** from initiatives like the Snow Leopard Trust contribute to biodiversity monitoring in parts of the Eurasian tundra.

**Soil Monitoring Programs:**
- **International Permafrost Association (IPA)** datasets track permafrost conditions and soil carbon content.

**Air Quality Monitoring Networks:**
- **AirBase** by the European Environment Agency provides air quality data relevant to the European part of the tundra.

**Remote Sensing Datasets:**
- **NASA's MODIS** and **ESA's Sentinel-2** datasets are used for land cover and vegetation change detection.

### 3. BIODIVERSITY AND SPECIES DATA

**Regional Species Inventories:**
- The **Arctic Biodiversity Assessment** report documents species presence and trends in the region.
- **IUCN Red List** data are crucial for understanding endangered species in the tundra.

**Protected Species Monitoring:**
- **WWF's Snow Leopard conservation program** monitors species populations in parts of the tundra.

**Natural History Collections:**
- **Natural History Museum (London)** and **Moscow State University's Zoological Museum** hold significant regional collections.

**Citizen Science Initiatives:**
- **eBird** and **iNaturalist** platforms collect biodiversity data through citizen contributions.

**Genetic and Genomic Datasets:**
- Research on genetic diversity of tundra plants like **Arctic cotton grass (Eriophorum angustifolium)** is conducted by universities such as the University of Alaska.

**Migration Tracking Data:**
- **Satellite tracking** of migratory birds and caribou provides insights into species migration patterns.

**Species Distribution Models:**
- **MaxEnt** models are used to predict species distributions under climate change scenarios.

### 4. LAND USE AND CONSERVATION DATASETS

**Protected Area Boundaries:**
- **World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA)** provides data on protected areas within the tundra.
- **IUCN's Green List of Protected Areas** assesses the effectiveness of these areas.

**Land Cover and Land Use Change:**
- **ESA's Climate Change Initiative (CCI)** offers land cover datasets.
- **NASA's Landsat** series provides historical land use change data.
