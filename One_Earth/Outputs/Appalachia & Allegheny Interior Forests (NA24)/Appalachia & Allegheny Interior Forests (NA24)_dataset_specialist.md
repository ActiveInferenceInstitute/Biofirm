### Data Access Conditions:
- Most datasets are publicly available, but some require research access or have usage restrictions.

### Interoperability Status:
- Interoperability can be challenging due to differences in data formats and spatial resolutions.

### Data Collection Methodologies and Quality Assurance:
- Methodologies vary widely, with some datasets relying on citizen science contributions and others on professional monitoring.
