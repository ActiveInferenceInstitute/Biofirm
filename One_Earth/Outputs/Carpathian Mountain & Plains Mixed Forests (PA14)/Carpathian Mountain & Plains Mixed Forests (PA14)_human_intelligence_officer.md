### Notes on Information Gaps

- **Detailed Contact Information:** Specific contact details for many stakeholders, especially local community leaders and emerging researchers, were not readily available due to privacy concerns or limited online presence.
- **Indigenous Governance:** The Carpathian region lacks large indigenous populations with formal governance structures, limiting the availability of specific indigenous leadership information.
- **Comprehensive Stakeholder Maps:** Creating detailed stakeholder maps requires continuous updates and collaboration with local stakeholders to ensure accuracy and inclusivity.
