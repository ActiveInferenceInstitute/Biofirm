### Tables and Organizational Charts

Given the complexity and breadth of stakeholders involved, detailed tables and organizational charts would be necessary to visualize the networks and influence dynamics fully. However, due to the limitations of this format, these visual aids cannot be included directly here but are recommended for further research and analysis.
