**Southeast Indonesian Dry Forest Islands (AU15)**

### 1. Ecological Characterization

**Climate Patterns and Ecosystems**: Southeast Indonesia, including islands like Java, Bali, and Lombok, experiences a tropical monsoon climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. This climate influences the regional ecosystems, with dry forests being the dominant biome in areas like Bali and Lombok. These forests are adapted to the seasonal droughts, hosting a diverse range of flora and fauna.

**Key Biomes and Habitats**:
- **Dry Forests**: Dominant in areas like Bali and Lombok, these forests are characterized by deciduous trees and are highly susceptible to fire during the dry season.
- **Tropical Rainforests**: Found in areas with higher rainfall, such as parts of Java.
- **Mangrove and Coral Reef Ecosystems**: Along coastal areas, these ecosystems provide crucial habitats for marine life and protect shorelines from erosion.

**Dominant and Keystone Species**:
- **Plant Species**: *Ficus spp.* and *Borassus flabellifer* are common in dry forests. Mangroves are also significant along the coasts.
- **Animal Species**: The **Javan leopard** and **Baliem wallaby** are endemic species in these regions.

**Seasonal Dynamics and Migration Patterns**: Seasonal migrations are less pronounced in these dry forests compared to other regions. However, birds and bats may migrate between islands in search of food and suitable habitats.

### 2. Environmental Challenges

**Climate Change Impacts**:
- Rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns exacerbate droughts and wildfires in dry forests.
- **Sea-Level Rise**: Threatens coastal ecosystems like mangroves and coral reefs.
