**Interoperability Status:**
- Integration of datasets across different platforms and formats remains a challenge.

**Data Collection Methodologies:**
- Field surveys and remote sensing are primary data collection methods.

**Suggestions for Priority Data Collection:**
- More focus is needed on long-term monitoring of lesser-known species and ecosystems, as well as integrating traditional ecological knowledge into conservation planning.

### 8. Research Expectations

The comprehensive analysis above highlights the importance of integrating diverse datasets to understand ecological, socio-economic, and conservation dynamics in the East African Coastal Forests. Future research should prioritize filling data gaps, enhancing interoperability, and engaging local communities in data collection and management.
