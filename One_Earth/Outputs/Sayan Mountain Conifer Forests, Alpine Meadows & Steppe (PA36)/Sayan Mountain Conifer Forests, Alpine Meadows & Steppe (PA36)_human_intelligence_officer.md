This detailed analysis will focus on the **Sayan Mountain Conifer Forests, Alpine Meadows & Steppe (PA36)** bioregion, providing a comprehensive overview of key stakeholders and actors involved in regional ecological systems, environmental challenges, economic activities, and sustainable development opportunities.

### 1. Academic and Research Stakeholders

**Leading Researchers and Institutions:**
- **Institute of Forest Science, Russian Academy of Sciences (IF RAS):** Known for its comprehensive studies on forest ecosystems and biodiversity conservation.
- **Krasnoyarsk State University:** Offers strong programs in biology and ecology relevant to the Sayan Mountains.
- **Siberian Federal University:** Conducts significant research in environmental science and natural resource management.
  
**Emerging Researchers:**
- Due to limited online information, further research is needed to identify emerging researchers in the Sayan Mountains region.

**Collaborative Research Initiatives:**
- The **RECONECT project** (though not specifically focused on PA36, it involves similar ecosystems) demonstrates collaborative approaches to ecological restoration that could be relevant to the Sayan Mountains.
- **International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)** initiatives may also be applicable, especially those related to mountain ecosystems.

### 2. Governmental and Policy Actors

**Relevant Government Agencies:**
- **Russian Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment:** Oversees conservation efforts and environmental policies at the federal level.
- **Regional Governments of Tuva and Buryatia:** Manage local environmental policies and resource management.
  
**Key Policymakers:**
- **Federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resource Use (Rosprirodnadzor):** Responsible for regulatory oversight of environmental management.
- **Local Administrations in Krasnoyarsk Krai and Irkutsk Oblast:** Involved in regional policy-making and resource management.

**Indigenous Governance:**
- **Tuvan and Buryat Indigenous Communities:** Hold significant cultural and territorial rights in the region.

### 3. Non-Governmental Organizations

**Conservation NGOs:**
- **WWF-Russia:** Active in conservation projects across Siberia, including efforts related to mountain ecosystems.
- **Greenpeace Russia:** Focuses on environmental protection and advocacy, potentially impacting regional conservation efforts.
  
**Community-Based Organizations:**
- Local community groups, such as those in Tuva and Buryatia, are crucial for grassroots initiatives but are not well-documented online.

**International NGOs:**
- **The Nature Conservancy:** Though not specifically focused on PA36, they engage in global conservation efforts that could be relevant.

### 4. Private Sector Entities

**Resource Extraction Companies:**
- **Rosneft and Gazprom:** Major players in resource extraction in Siberia, though specific operations in PA36 are not well-documented.
  
**Sustainable Businesses:**
- Limited online information is available on green businesses specifically operating in the Sayan Mountains region. Further research is needed.

### 5. Indigenous and Local Community Leaders

**Tribal Elders and Knowledge Keepers:**
- Specific names of tribal elders are not readily available online. However, indigenous communities in Tuva and Buryatia play significant roles in cultural and ecological preservation.

**Community Organizers:**
- Local environmental justice movements are not well-documented online, indicating a need for deeper community engagement.

### 6. Influential Individuals and Networks

**Environmental Activists:**
- Activists from broader environmental movements in Russia may influence regional discussions, but specific figures are not well-documented.

**Journalists and Media Figures:**
- Local media outlets in Tuva and Buryatia may cover environmental issues, but specific journalists are not readily identified online.

### 7. Stakeholder Network Analysis

**Collaborative Partnerships:**
- Interactions between government agencies, NGOs, and local communities are crucial for successful conservation efforts, but specific partnerships are not well-documented.

**Power Dynamics and Conflicts:**
- Tensions between resource extraction activities and conservation efforts are likely present, though specific examples are not readily available online.

**Opportunities for New Partnerships:**
- Developing partnerships between local indigenous communities and international NGOs could enhance conservation outcomes and promote sustainable practices.

### Research Expectations and Gaps

**Comprehensive Response:**
- This analysis highlights the need for more detailed, on-the-ground research to fully capture the complexity of stakeholders in the Sayan Mountains bioregion.

**Exhaustive Internet Research:**
- Despite extensive online research, specific details about some stakeholders remain elusive, indicating the necessity for deeper engagement with local communities and institutions.

**Organizational Charts and Maps:**
- Creating detailed stakeholder maps and organizational charts would require access to more specific data on local collaborations and governance structures.
