## Introduction
The **Greater California (NA31)** bioregion encompasses a diverse range of ecosystems, stretching from the Pacific coast to the Great Basin and including parts of California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona. This region is characterized by its Mediterranean climate, mountainous terrain, and a variety of biomes, including coastal scrub, chaparral, and temperate rainforests.

## 1. Ecological Characterization

### Climate Patterns
The Greater California bioregion experiences a Mediterranean climate, with dry summers and wet winters. The climate varies significantly across different regions, with coastal areas generally cooler and more humid than inland areas. This climatic variation supports a wide range of biodiversity.

### Key Biomes and Ecosystems
- **Coastal Ecosystems**: Include coastal scrub, salt marshes, and mangroves, which provide habitat for diverse marine life and support coastal resilience.
- **Chaparral**: A dominant biome characterized by drought-resistant shrubs, often found on hillsides and mountains.
- **Temperate Rainforests**: Located in the Pacific Northwest, these forests are among the most productive ecosystems globally.
- **Deserts**: The Mojave and Sonoran Deserts are significant components of this bioregion, hosting unique desert flora and fauna.

### Dominant and Keystone Species
- **Plants**: California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum), coastal sagebrush (Artemisia californica), and giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) are notable plants.
- **Animals**: California condor (Gymnogyps californianus), mountain lion (Puma concolor), and desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) are iconic species.
- **Endemic Species**: The island fox (Urocyon littoralis) on the Channel Islands is an example of an endemic species in this bioregion.

### Seasonal Ecological Dynamics and Migration Patterns
- Seasonal changes drive migration patterns of species like the monarch butterfly and gray whale.
- Fire is a natural part of the chaparral ecosystem, with some plants relying on fire for seed germination.

## 2. Environmental Challenges

### Climate Change Impacts
