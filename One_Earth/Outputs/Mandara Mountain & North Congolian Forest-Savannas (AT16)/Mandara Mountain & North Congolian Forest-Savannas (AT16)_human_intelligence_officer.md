## 8. Research Expectations

### Comprehensive Responses
This analysis provides a detailed overview of stakeholders in the Mandara Mountain & North Congolian Forest-Savannas bioregion but highlights the need for field research to gather more specific information on local community leaders and emerging researchers.

### Internet Research Limitations
While internet research can identify major stakeholders and organizations, detailed information about local dynamics, especially concerning indigenous governance and community leadership, requires more nuanced engagement with local sources.
