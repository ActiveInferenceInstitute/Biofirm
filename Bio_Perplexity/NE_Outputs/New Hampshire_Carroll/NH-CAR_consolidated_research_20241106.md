### Regional Ecological Systems and Biodiversity

Carroll County in New Hampshire is part of several distinct ecological regions, each with its own unique biodiversity and ecological characteristics.

#### Ecoregions
Carroll County falls within multiple ecoregions, including the White Mountains/Blue Mountains, the Sebago-Ossipee Hills and Plains, and the Northern Connecticut Valley. These regions are characterized by diverse landforms and climates. The White Mountains/Blue Mountains ecoregion is known for its high-elevation, rugged terrain and colder climate, hosting alpine and subalpine communities such as alpine herbaceous snowbank, moist alpine herb-heath meadow, and alpine ravine shrub thickets.

#### Biodiversity
The region is rich in biodiversity, with a variety of plant and animal species. The Sebago-Ossipee Hills and Plains ecoregion includes lake-rich areas and diverse habitats such as forests, wetlands, and coastal dunes. This diversity supports a wide range of flora and fauna, including rare plants and animals. For example, the Ossipee Lake watershed, which is partly in Carroll County, is dominantly forested and features various ecosystems including sandy shorelines, deltas, and postglacial sediment redistribution, supporting a dynamic and biodiverse landscape.

### Environmental Challenges and Opportunities

#### Climate Change
The region is vulnerable to climate change, which affects snowfall patterns, temperature, and habitat availability. Species such as the lynx and marten, found in adjacent regions like the Western Maine Mountains, are sensitive to these changes and may see their ranges contract to higher elevations and further north.

#### Land Use and Development
Historical land use changes, such as widespread forest clearance, dam construction, and agricultural conversion, have impacted the natural habitats in Carroll County. These activities have led to the displacement of native populations and altered the ecological balance. However, the current low level of agricultural use (1%) and developed land (4.5%) in the Ossipee Lake watershed suggests opportunities for sustainable land management practices.

#### Conservation Efforts
The region offers significant opportunities for conservation and restoration. The presence of unfragmented forests and complex topography makes it a highly resilient landscape. Efforts to protect and restore habitats can leverage the natural diversity of the area, including the identification of landscape-scale focus areas of ecological significance.
