### Regional Ecological Systems and Biodiversity

Cheshire County, located in the southwestern part of New Hampshire, is characterized by a diverse range of ecological systems and biodiversity.

#### Ecoregions
Cheshire County falls within several ecoregions, including the Northeastern Highlands and the Northeastern Coastal Zone. Specifically, it encompasses parts of the Worcester/Monadnock Plateau, the Northern Connecticut Valley, and the Sunapee Uplands.

#### Natural Communities
The region hosts various natural communities such as alpine and subalpine communities, open uplands, shrub-dominated communities, and riparian outcrops. Notable communities include alpine herbaceous snowbank, moist alpine herb-heath meadow, and alder alluvial shrubland. The county also features emergent marshes, aquatic beds, and shrub thickets.

#### Biodiversity
The area is home to a variety of flora and fauna. The New Hampshire Natural Heritage Bureau maintains a comprehensive database of rare plants and animals, which includes species found in Cheshire County. This database is crucial for understanding and protecting the local biodiversity.

### Environmental Challenges and Opportunities

#### Conservation Efforts
Organizations like the Cheshire County Conservation District play a significant role in promoting stewardship for healthy soils, ecologically sound farms, diverse wildlife, sustainable forests, and healthy watersheds. These efforts help mitigate environmental challenges and preserve natural resources.

#### Climate and Geography
The county's geography, with its hill-and-valley regions and significant waterways like the Ashuelot and Cold rivers, presents both challenges and opportunities. The varied climate and elevation changes can impact local ecosystems, but they also provide diverse habitats for various species.

#### Water Resources
The presence of lakes, rivers, and wetlands is both an asset and a challenge. These water resources need careful management to ensure their sustainability and to protect against pollution and other environmental hazards.

### Economic and Industrial Landscape

#### Historical Industries
Cheshire County has a historical background in industries such as pottery, glass, furniture, and textiles manufacturing, particularly in the city of Keene. Other communities have been involved in milling, yarn making, woodworking, and glassmaking.

#### Current Economy
The county's economy is now based on tourism and the manufacture of metal products and industrial machinery. This shift indicates a diversification of industries, which can support a more stable economic environment.

#### Agricultural Sector
The county also has a significant agricultural sector, with a focus on ecologically sound farming practices. This sector contributes to the local economy and helps in maintaining the environmental health of the area.

### Regulatory Environment and Compliance Requirements

#### State and Federal Regulations
Biotechnology and biological manufacturing in Cheshire County must comply with both state and federal regulations. Key areas include environmental regulations, health and safety standards, and biosafety guidelines.

- **Environmental Regulations**: Compliance with the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is crucial for managing waste, water quality, and air emissions.
- **Health and Safety**: Adherence to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards and guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is necessary for ensuring workplace safety.
- **Biosafety**: Facilities must comply with biosafety level (BSL) requirements set by the CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

#### Local Regulations
Cheshire County and the city of Keene may have additional local regulations and zoning laws that impact biotech facilities. These regulations could pertain to land use, water usage, and waste disposal.

### Potential for Sustainable Biotech Development

#### Resources and Infrastructure
Cheshire County has the potential for sustainable biotech development due to its existing infrastructure and resources:
- **Educational Institutions**: Proximity to educational institutions can provide a skilled workforce and opportunities for research collaborations.
- **Agricultural Sector**: The county's agricultural sector can serve as a foundation for biotech applications in agriculture, such as genetically modified crops or bioproducts.
- **Conservation Efforts**: The strong conservation ethos in the county can support sustainable biotech practices that align with environmental stewardship.

#### Economic Incentives
The county's economic landscape, with its mix of tourism and manufacturing, can provide incentives for biotech companies looking to establish sustainable operations. State and local government incentives for sustainable industries can further support this development.

### Local Resources and Infrastructure

#### Workforce and Education
The city of Keene and surrounding areas have access to educational institutions that can provide a skilled workforce. This includes Keene State College and other nearby universities that offer programs in sciences and technology.

#### Transportation and Utilities
Cheshire County has adequate transportation infrastructure, including roads and highways, which facilitate the movement of goods and personnel. The availability of utilities such as water, electricity, and internet connectivity is also crucial for biotech operations.

#### Research and Development
Collaborations with local research institutions and universities can provide access to advanced research facilities and expertise, which is essential for biotech innovation.

In summary, Cheshire County, New Hampshire, offers a unique blend of ecological diversity, economic opportunities, and regulatory frameworks that can support the development of sustainable biotechnology and biological manufacturing. By leveraging local resources, complying with regulatory requirements, and aligning with environmental conservation efforts, biotech companies can thrive in this region.
