Operational costs are assumed to increase by 5% annually due to inflation and growth.\n- **Funding Requirements**: Initial capital and venture capital are assumed to be secured in the first year. Grants and loans are spread over the first three years.\n- **Financial Metrics**: ROI, NPV, and IRR are calculated based on the projected revenue and cost structure. Payback period is estimated based on the initial investment and projected cash flows.\n- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Scenarios are based on potential market and operational risks. Impacts are estimated based on the sensitivity of revenue and costs to these changes.\n- **Sustainability Metrics**: Targets are set based on industry benchmarks and local environmental goals. Annual improvements are assumed to be achieved through continuous investment in sustainability initiatives.",
