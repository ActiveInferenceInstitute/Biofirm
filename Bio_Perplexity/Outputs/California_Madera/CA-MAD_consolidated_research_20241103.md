### Regional Ecological Systems and Biodiversity

The Madera County region in California is part of the larger San Joaquin Valley bioregion, which is characterized by a diverse array of ecological systems despite significant alterations due to human activities.

#### Ecosystems
- **Grasslands and Oak Woodlands**: Historically, the area was dominated by native grasslands and riparian oak woodlands. However, these ecosystems have been severely reduced due to agricultural development and urbanization. Only a fraction of the original grasslands and oak woodlands remain, primarily in protected areas and fragmented patches.
- **Wetlands and Waterways**: The San Joaquin River and its tributaries run through Madera County, supporting riparian ecosystems that are crucial for biodiversity. However, these wetlands have been significantly impacted by agricultural drainage, water diversion, and habitat destruction.
